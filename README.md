# Fallout Community Edition

Fallout Community Edition is a fully working re-implementation of Fallout, with the same original gameplay, engine bugfixes, and some quality of life improvements, that works (mostly) hassle-free on multiple platforms.

There is also [Fallout 2 Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout2-ce).

## Installation

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38400). Download latest [release](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce/releases) or build from source. You can also check latest [debug](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce/actions) build intended for testers.

### Windows

Download and copy `fallout-ce.exe` to your `Fallout` folder. It serves as a drop-in replacement for `falloutw.exe`.

### Linux

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout` folder somewhere, for example `/home/john/Desktop/Fallout`.

- Alternatively you can extract the needed files from the GoG installer:

```console
$ sudo apt install innoextract
$ innoextract ~/Downloads/setup_fallout_2.1.0.18.exe -I app
$ mv app Fallout
```

- Download and copy `fallout-ce` to this folder.

- Install [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php):

```console
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
```

- Run `./fallout-ce`.

### macOS

> **NOTE**: macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher is required. Runs natively on Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout`.

- Alternatively you can use Fallout from MacPlay/The Omni Group as a base - you need to extract game assets from the original bundle. Mount CD/DMG, right click `Fallout` -> `Show Package Contents`, navigate to `Contents/Resources`. Copy `GameData` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout`.

- Or if you're a Terminal user and have Homebrew installed you can extract the needed files from the GoG installer:

```console
$ brew install innoextract
$ innoextract ~/Downloads/setup_fallout_2.1.0.18.exe -I app
$ mv app /Applications/Fallout
```

- Download and copy `fallout-ce.app` to this folder.

- Run `fallout-ce.app`.

### Android

> **NOTE**: Fallout was designed with mouse in mind. There are many controls that require precise cursor positioning, which is not possible with fingers. Current control scheme resembles trackpad usage:
> - One finger moves mouse cursor around.
> - Tap one finger for left mouse click.
> - Tap two fingers for right mouse click (switches mouse cursor mode).
> - Move two fingers to scroll current view (map view, worldmap view, inventory scrollers).

> **NOTE**: From Android standpoint release and debug builds are different apps. Both apps require their own copy of game assets and have their own savegames. This is intentional. As a gamer just stick with release version and check for updates.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout` folder to your device, for example to `Downloads`. You need `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data` folder. Watch for file names - keep (or make) them lowercased (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

- Download `fallout-ce.apk` and copy it to your device. Open it with file explorer, follow instructions (install from unknown source).

- When you run the game for the first time it will immediately present file picker. Select the folder from the first step. Wait until this data is copied. A loading dialog will appear, just wait for about 30 seconds. The game will start automatically.

### iOS

> **NOTE**: See Android note on controls.

- Download `fallout-ce.ipa`. Use sideloading applications ([AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)) to install it to your device. Alternatively you can always build from source with your own signing certificate.

- Run the game once. You'll see error message saying "Could not find the master datafile...". This step is needed for iOS to expose the game via File Sharing feature.

- Use Finder (macOS Catalina and later) or iTunes (Windows and macOS Mojave or earlier) to copy `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data` folder to "Fallout" app ([how-to](https://support.apple.com/HT210598)). Watch for file names - keep (or make) them lowercased (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `fallout.cfg`. There are several important settings you might need to adjust for your installation. Depending on your Fallout distribution main game assets `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data` folder might be either all lowercased, or all uppercased. You can either update `master_dat`, `critter_dat`, `master_patches` and `critter_patches` settings to match your file names, or rename files to match entries in your `fallout.cfg`.

The `sound` folder (with `music` folder inside) might be located either in `data` folder, or be in the Fallout folder. Update `music_path1` setting to match your hierarchy, usually it's `data/sound/music/` or `sound/music/`. Make sure it match your path exactly (so it might be `SOUND/MUSIC/` if you've installed Fallout from CD). Music files themselves (with `ACM` extension) should be all uppercased, regardless of `sound` and `music` folders.

The second configuration file is `f1_res.ini`. Use it to change game window size and enable/disable fullscreen mode.

```ini
[MAIN]
SCR_WIDTH=1280
SCR_HEIGHT=720
WINDOWED=1
```

Recommendations:
- **Desktops**: Use any size you see fit.
- **Tablets**: Set these values to logical resolution of your device, for example iPad Pro 11 is 1668x2388 (pixels), but it's logical resolution is 834x1194 (points).
- **Mobile phones**: Set height to 480, calculate width according to your device screen (aspect) ratio, for example Samsung S21 is 20:9 device, so the width should be 480 * 20 / 9 = 1067.

### Rendering Backend

You can specify the rendering backend SDL should use by adding the `render_driver` option to your `fallout.cfg` file under the `[video]` section. This can be useful for compatibility or performance reasons on different systems.

Example `fallout.cfg` entry:
```ini
[video]
render_driver=opengl
```

Possible values for `render_driver` are:
- `direct3d`
- `direct3d11`
- `direct3d12`
- `opengl`
- `opengles2`
- `opengles`
- `metal`
- `software`

If the `render_driver` option is not specified, it will default to "opengl". If the specified driver (or the default "opengl") is not available or fails to initialize, SDL will attempt to use another available backend based on its internal preference list.

The availability of these rendering backends depends on the user's operating system, graphics hardware, drivers, and the way SDL2 was compiled. For example, "metal" is specific to Apple platforms, and "direct3d" variants are specific to Windows. The "software" renderer is a fallback that should always be available but may offer lower performance.

In time this stuff will receive in-game interface, right now you have to do it manually.

## Contributing

Here is a couple of current goals. Open up an issue if you have suggestion or feature request.

- **Update to v1.2**. This project is based on Reference Edition which implements v1.1 released in November 1997. There is a newer v1.2 released in March 1998 which at least contains important multilingual support.

- **Backport some Fallout 2 features**. Fallout 2 (with some Sfall additions) added many great improvements and quality of life enhancements to the original Fallout engine. Many deserve to be backported to Fallout 1. Keep in mind this is a different game, with slightly different gameplay balance (which is a fragile thing on its own).

## Kiosk

Custom config `kiosk.cfg`

```
[game]
;barter modifier for start inventory trade
barter_mod=0
;how much caps add to player for start inventory trade
caps_start=2000
;how much experience add at game start
exp_start=1000
;in how much seconds player inactivity dweller will die
inact=120
;first attention dialog box
inact1=100
;second
inact2=30
;last
inact3=20
;allow player interact with options menu
options=0
;allow player to save/load game
saveload=0

;override original config options
[overrides]
combat_difficulty=0
game_difficulty=0
language_filter=0


```


Start inventory config `kiosk_inv.cfg`
```
[inventory]
PID=COUNT
```

Example:
```
[inventory]
111=1
231=34
10=3
11=64
55=1
43=32
23=22
```
